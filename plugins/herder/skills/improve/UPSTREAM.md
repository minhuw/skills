Herder-specific modifications:

- package Improve as the `herder:improve` skill;
- produce plans only from verified repository findings and route user-defined new features to Grill;
- write plans to `herder-plans/` through the shared Herder Plans protocol and template;
- validate generated plans with the Herder plan manager;
- delegate execution to Herder Fire instead of maintaining a second scheduler;
- adapt reconciliation and status ownership to Herder Plans; and
- normalize skill metadata for Codex and Claude plugin discovery.
